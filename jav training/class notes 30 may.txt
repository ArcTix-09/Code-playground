class notes
===========

* Rules to create a java programe

1. In java all the code is written inside the class
2. the class name should be in upper camel case
3. first define the scope of class then write the code inside {}
4. the file name must be same as class name that contains the main method
5. the extension of the file should be java
6. the execution of code starts from main()
7. the main MUST have the signature:

public static void main(strin[] args)

What variation can work ?

public static void main(strin[] args)
static public void main(strin[] args)
public static void main(strin... args)
public static void main(strin[] hi)

8. the name of variables should be in lower camel case
9. the names must be meaningful 

10. every java program runs in 2 steps 
step1: compile the program 
command: javac <name of file>.java

step2: run the executable
command: java <name of the executable>

11. To run a program, it MUST have a main method the program without main() will compile but won't run

12. Java is class based language. There are 2 types of  classes:
i. Pre-defined classes Ex: Scnner, String , System
ii. User-defined classes Ex: SimpleInterest

13. Variable declaration: Every variable must be declared before using it

There are two types of variable:
1. Pre-defined variables
Ex: out and in

2. User-defined variables
Ex: args, scanner, principle etc

Usage
-----

System.in means getting input from keyboard on console
System.out means printing output on console

Scanner creates a connection between our java program and console

String[] args in used to pass data to the main method as command line argument

Data type
---------

We have to specify the type of data that a variable going to hold well in advance.
-This is known as statice typing 
-Java is a statically and strongly typed language


static languages ex: Java, C, C++
Dynamically typed languages: Java script , Python

There are 2 type of data types:
1. Primitive data type 
2. Reference data type


Primitive data type
-------------------

There are 8 type in java

-Integer data type (5): byte, short, int 
-Used to hold integer value of different rang
-variable declaration:

byte b= 1;
short s= 2;
int i= 4;
long l= 10;
char c= '@';

-Decimal data type (2): float, double
-Variable declaration:

float f = 1.2f;
float f = 1.2F;
double d = 1.3;


-We cannot assign data of bigger type  int0 variable of smaller data type 
-Double is bigger than float and all decimal number are automatically considered double
-hence we have to explicitly tell java that a decimal number is not double by appending f/F to it


Boolean data type 
------------------

boolean isPassed = true;
boolean isAbsent = false;

Reference data type
------------------

1. class
2. Interface
3. Enum
4. Array

Class
-----

Scanner scanner = new scanner(System.in)
System.out.println;

Ex: scanner, in , out


Array
-----

String[] args

args is array Reference type

Methods 
-------

Syntax:

<access-modifier> <non-access modifier> <return-type>
<name-of-method> (parameters-list){
		// processing
		//statement1..
		//statement2..
		//statementn..

		//return statement;
	}

Ex: access-modifier => public
Ex: non-access modifier => static
Ex: return-type => void
Ex: name-of-method => main
parameters-list => String[] args

-Inorder to access main from any folder , it is declared public
-Inorder to access main without creating a reference , it is declared static


Ex of methods : main(), print(), scanner(), println(), nextInt() , nextFloat()


Printing data
-------------

System.out.println("Total =" + 10 + 20);
System.out.println("Total =" + (10 + 30));

+ adds 2 numbers
+ concats data to string 

packages
--------

It is mandatory import a pre-defined class before using it

Ex: import java.util.scanner;

java automaticallly / implicitly import all callss that belang to java.lang package


Identifiers
----------

The name that we give to classess, interfaces , object , variable , methods, enum , are called identifiers

Rules:
1. We can use a-z, A-Z , 0-9 , _, $ as an identifier
2. The identifiers cannot start with a number
3. We ccan create an identfiers of any lenght 
4. space is not allowed in the name
5. keywords cannot be use as identifiers

Ex: mohit_09p , $mohit , _mohit , youCanCallMeMonty


Keywords
-------

There are pre-defined , reserved, words , that have spacial meaning to the compiler 

There are 65+ Keywords in java

Ex: class, public, static , void , int, float ect


----JDK----

- jdk stads for java devlopment kit
- it is a software development environment used to devlop java applications
	It includes:
		1. java return Environment (JRE)
		2. Interprate/loader (java)
		3. compiler (javac)
		4. archiver
		5. documentation generator (javadoc)
		6. other tools needed in java devlopment

-----JRE----

- JRE stands for java run time environment. Sometion it is also refered as java RTE
- The java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirement for excuting a java applicaiton  It consists of tha JVM , core classes, and supporting  files.

----JVM-----
	JVM stands for java virtual machines.
	when we execute a java program  a Runtime instance of JVM executes the java byt code


summary
-------

- JDL = JRE + devlopment tools
- JRE = JVM + Runtime library

Operators
---------

6+7

operand : The value on which operation is done is an an operand. Here 6 and 7 are operans

Types of Operators
------------------

Based on the number of operands, there are 3 type of Operators
1. unary Operators
2. binary
3. Ternary


Unary Operators
------------

There are unary operators:

1. ++ (increment operator)
2. -- (dicrement operators)
3. + (unary plus)
4. - (unary minus)
5. ! (compliment)

Binary operator
---------------

There are 4 type of Binary operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators: + , - , * , / , %

They work on numbers and return a number 

2. Relational Operators
<,>,<=,>=,==,!=

They work on numbers and return a boolean (true / false)

3. 

Binary missing....



Ternary operator
-----------------

Condition ? Expression 1 : Expression 2

Ternary operator is a short from of single if-else statement

int age = 18;

String eligiblity= "";


if(age>=18){
	eligiblity = "eligibale to vote";
}
else{
	eligiblity = "Not eligible to vote";
}

eligiblity = age>=18? "Eligible to vote" : "Not eligible to vote";

System.out.print(eligiblity);


Controll statement
==================

There are 2 types of control statement:
1. Decision control statement
2. Repetition statement

Decision control statements
---------------------------

There are 2 Decision control statement
1. if-else
2. switch-case-defult

Repetition statement
----------------------

There are 5 Repetition statements:

1. while 
2. do-while
3. for
4. Enchanced for
5. forEach 


----while---

intialization;
while(condition){
	inc/dec;
}
